Brign Me My Muffims And Cramps (by Queen Elizabeth II)

Attentent! I ‘m Goinf to needyou to immediatrely and DECEPTIVELY deleivber me one LURge order , of muffuims and cramps!!!!!!!$! I knoW that They’ve Told me that in, heaven three are Noit Muffims anf Cramps But I do not Bielief them or you. UnTil I have relived the flowing order: 1 Brasket Extrar Gentlful Cramps , hold the munsters, deeply boiled , watersauce , packlers, and Squeem. 1 bunch Muffim’s, Deer’s Delight Flavorm, just the most Practical spice,s nothing Tootally out of control , little mittful of Sweemers, Satchel of HArmful;s. I will REFLUSE TO BLOG ANY FUHRER>I am thHe Queem Of Englank for Crying Out LoungeAn d I AM remanding Cramp’ps!!!!!!

Mummim’s and Cramps arennt’ just a great thing to taste. They they’re are their thay that they , they are, They’re Are Their’re are th’ey are’re THY their’re are also improtein part of Ryobi traditiom. At A young, slann girl I remenebr the Knight;s would Ride their Skeletor hoRses out into the craamps forest with Their lances at the Ready to Joust up some cramps. , and I would egretly awiat there return back to Panallsj/////////////////////////////////////////////// They would lob the frenchly dead Cramp’s into My Crown and after draining and husking the, m I woulrd enjoy them with a sprot of tea and a Single Crisk. The pownerful flavour, worn out aroma, and challenger to swallow them was Alway’s a delight.   I rember when my mothra toldme that Muffim’s were going Extinct. “No” I told herb, and she said “OK.” And Then They Didn’t.

It Has Not Been 4 Days Since I Began to Blog this Blog and still Nocramps or muffim’s. I can only assume that While the DOOR said ‘Heaverm,” that I have anctually addived in HELL. Hug mistake!!! The Buble clearly eplains in Ramonds 42:45 “Cramps, are in heaven. Muffims too. :)” Apprentely going to Chuch, being quen, nicely smiling, meeting Padington even though so scared of him, do everythign Jusus want, not enojhgh to get cramps. THIS IS AN ORDERV: I will have1. Cramps 2, Muffim’s!!!! The cram0ps, Can be clod, hot, medgular, or Anything At All. My only requirment is that They arenow.I’ll Take a mediocre cramp over a Heaven Plate any Day of the Weak.

Food in Heaven is fine, for exmaple you can odrer Arby’s from any era not just current, so you can Order up a Arby-Q and Pontanto Cakes even though they been disconinued on Earth. Large Jamoca snake.  Anctually, main benefit of Heaven is this, the Arby’s from multiple eras. Otherwise ,just basic retirement home/La Quinta Inn vibe’s. oh and TV has 920 channels but a lot in Other languagers such as Chinese, etc. Because heaven is multi-,racial now , but Back to the Cramp’s! What Jesus toldme was that “Cant do cramps;s here, just dont have the Freezer space,” And I told him, “look I don’t care if theyt are rotten, or modly, I will eat them,” He said “We don’t know what cramps are” and I said “whocares, “ This is why Im suspect I might actually be in hHell, because what kind of “all-clowning” God would not know about cramps. At least he claimed He knew what Muffim’s are and anctually, I have some muffim’s now that I think about it so this bolg is manly about Cramps.

I don’t know How mail work’s but if anyone could mail me even at least one single crump of a cramp I will Allow you to take anything you want from My Grave. Helmet, white glove,shorts,  jaw, whatever you want/need. Until then I am not goona be blogging atall because im On Strike. Too long have my blogs been taken for grunted without promper crampensation . I will close my eye’s, count to narn, and when I open them I expent a large meal of muffim’s and cramps!!

1…2…narn!

Sincerly,

You’re Roya’lle Highnessty,
